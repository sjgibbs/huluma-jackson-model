Java Classes for databinding via Jackson to Huluma.net endpoints

## Naming

The name `net.huluma.model` is the more stable package name, derived from the commercial project.

The maven group id `com.github.sjgibbs` was chosen for convenience based on the default scheme of jitpack.io.

Hopefully if ever I roll my own full deployment pipeline it's a one line change in your POM.
