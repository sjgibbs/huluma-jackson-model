Java classes for databinding via Jackson to Huluma.net endpoints

Get it from jitpack:

https://jitpack.io/#sjgibbs/huluma-jackson-model/2.0-ea

## Naming

The name `net.huluma.model` is the more stable package name, derived from the commercial project.

The maven group id `com.github.sjgibbs` is the default scheme of jitpack.io
and I see no strong reason for it to be different from that.

Hopefully if ever I change my deployment pipeline it's a one line change in your POM.
